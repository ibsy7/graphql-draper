# One Sentence Pitch

API as a user-friendly service, using the new best-in-class technology GraphQL, which you completely own. You are the master of it: no one else. There's not a database company, there's not even AWS - there's just you and the server.

# Advantages

1. better security
2. greater ease of use

# Security

There are data breaches happening all the time. The problem with this is that these data breaches can happen at your database company, too. Ebay; Uber; Anthem (health care); Verisign; Equifax - all have been hacked, credit card info, lost.

When you host your data somewhere - say, at a famous database company - you not only have to trust the infrastructure providers (Amazon Web Services), but also the engineers at that database company. Even if you have the best possible security practices, it doesn't matter if MongoDB screws up and your data is compromised. 

There are companies that will literally ask database or service providers, "what security precautions do you have in place," and will then have to turn them down when they say, "nothing special" or just "general best practices". It's not good enough for hospitals or health care orgs (look up: HIPAA) and other companies that are really strict about data. Or maybe you, as an executive, just really care a lot about security, and don't want some lazy company you know nothing about to screw it up (his happens too). Like you'd think JP Morgan sounds really secure - but they were hacked too, same problem. If you can't trust JP Morgan, who can you trust?

# Greater Ease of Use

It often happens that you, say, as an entrepeneur, learn some programming - some JavaScript, maybe React, plus CSS and HTML - and you're ready to debut a project. It's hard enough to learn the above, the complexity keeps rising, and just keeping on top of, say, React and mastering it is all you have time to do.

Now, to take it to the next level - say, to run an online marketplace - you absolutely have to learn the data store part. Because for things like authentication - for your website to have multiple users who can login - and an updated catalog - you need a more powerful data store, there's no way you can do that with static text files or some plain text files holding your data.

So we're building a service with a nice front end - input forms, some selection - that make it easy for you to set up a data back end and start working with it. Now you have enough power at your fingertips to set up an marketplace and have people use it, just like that. If you don't have the budget to hire a database person and you don't understand the available data stores, your project is dead. With our service, it's enough enough for you to understand and run on your own, without hiring anybody else - just your knowledge of JavaScript, and our service, is enough to create a marketplace or something and go to town.
